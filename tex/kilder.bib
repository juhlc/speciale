abstract = {A practical method is proposed to determine the minimum embedding dimension from a scalar time series. It has the following advantages: (1) does not contain any subjective parameters except for the time-delay for the embedding; (2) does not strongly depend on how many data points are available; (3) can clearly distinguish deterministic signals from stochastic signals; (4) works well for time series from high-dimensional attractors; (5) is computationally efficient. Several time series are tested to show the above advantages of the method.}

abstract="Natural ecosystems are often complex, dynamic and state-dependent (i.e., nonlinear), and it is difficult to forecast their (near) future states if we rely only on linear statistical approaches. In the past few decades, tools of nonlinear time series analysis have been developed to analyze and forecast the state-dependent behavior of nonlinear systems. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system, and thus are suitable for analyzing systems which are complex and for which it is therefore often difficult to make reasonable assumptions about their underlying mechanisms. Instead of assuming equations, these methods recover the dynamics (and potentially, their underlying mechanism) directly from time series data, and are thus called Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM). In this chapter, we will introduce a basic concept in EDM (i.e., state space reconstruction) and explain practical and detailed algorithms of two core EDM tools (i.e., simplex projection and S-map) to forecast ecological time series. Then, we show applications of this algorithm to community ecology and its potential to answer ecological questions.",

The objectives of the paper are to clarify the concepts involved, isolate the essential requirements for a variable to be exogenous, and relate them to notions of predeterminedness, strict exogeneity and causality in order to facilitate econometric modelling. Worlds of parameter change are considered and exogeneity is related to structural invariance leading to a definition of super exogeneity. Throughout the paper, illustrative models are used to exposit the analysis.},

The main algorithm is based on a partitioning process and the use of interval arithmetic with directed rounding. As an application, we prove that the Lorenz equations support a strange attractor, as conjectured by Edward Lorenz in 1963. This conjecture was recently listed by Steven Smale as one of several challenging problems for the twenty-first century. We also prove that the attractor is robust, i.e., it persists under small perturbations of the coefficients in the underlying differential equations. Furthermore, the flow of the equations admits a unique SRB measure, whose support coincides with the attractor. The proof is based on a combination of normal form theory and rigorous computations.},

 abstract={Convex optimization now plays an essential role in many facets of statistics. We briefly survey some recent developments and describe some implementations of these methods in R . Applications of linear and quadratic programming are introduced including quantile regression, the Huber M-estimator and various penalized regression methods. Applications to additively separable convex problems subject to linear equality and inequality constraints such as nonparametric density estimation and maximum likelihood estimation of general nonparametric mixture models are described, as are several cone programming problems. We focus throughout primarily on implementations in the R environment that rely on solution methods linked to R, like MOSEK by the package Rmosek. Code is provided in R to illustrate several of these problems. Other applications are available in the R package REBayes, dealing with empirical Bayes estimation of nonparametric mixture models.},

pages={637-672},
abstract={We present a general-purpose solver for convex quadratic programs based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, employing a novel operator splitting technique that requires the solution of a quasi-definite linear system with the same coefficient matrix at almost every iteration. Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.},

 abstract = {An algorithm for computing parametric linear quantile regression estimates subject to linear inequality constraints is described. The algorithm is a variant of the interior point algorithm described in Koenker and Portnoy (1997) for unconstrained quantile regression and is consequently quite efficient even for large problems, particularly when the inherent sparsity of the resulting linear algebra is exploited. Applications to qualitatively constrained nonparametric regression are described in the penultimate sections. Implementations of the algorithm are available in MATLAB and R.},
